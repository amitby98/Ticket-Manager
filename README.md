# Ticket Manager Final 2/5

## What is this?

- The app will load the database data and show it as tickets.
- Each ticket can have its own labels or none.
- Every ticket describes a different issue and provides information about it, who wrote it, and at what time.
- Tickets can be searched up (by title) in a non case-sensitive way.
- Each ticket can be hidden by pressing the "hide" button, this will eliminate the ticket from the page. it also shows how many tickets are hidden
- Tickets that are hidden can be shown again by pressing "show all" button.
- The button to show all tickets will only be visible if there is one or more tickets hidden.

## Collaborations

- This final was partially written by Amit [amitby98](https://github.com/amitby98) and Niv [Niv200](https://github.com/Niv200).
- We finally sat down in real life and worked on it together :)

## Bonus

1. Tickets content is only shown partially, this is in order to make all tickets more readable.
2. Pressing "show more" will show the entire ticket content on a popup text that can be closed later on.
3. Added a "mark" button on the ticket, this will mark the ticket and change its colour to green.
